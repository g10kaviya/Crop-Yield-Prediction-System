# Crop-Yield-Prediction-System

This project presents a machine learning-based crop yield prediction system designed to help agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions. Utilizing historical agricultural data including climatic conditions, soil quality, and cultivation parameters, the system employs advanced regression algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regressor, and Gradient Boosting to accurately forecast crop yield. The project emphasizes rigorous data preprocessing, including categorical encoding, outlier handling using Interquartile Range (IQR) and Winsorization methods, and feature scaling to improve model performance and robustness. Comprehensive comparative analysis identifies the best-performing models and outlier treatment approaches through evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared scores. The resulting prediction pipeline aims to provide scalable, practical, and interpretable crop yield forecasts, supporting efficient agricultural management and policy-making.
